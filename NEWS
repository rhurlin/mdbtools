Version 0.9.0
=============

MDB Tools is under new management! Update your bookmarks and tell your favorite
search engine that this is our new home on the WWW:

MDB Tools 0.9.0 builds off the fork of cyberemissary on GitHub, collects many
years of unapplied patches, and includes a number of internal improvements.
Besides a host of security fixes, GLib is now completely optional, files can
be opened completely in-memory, and many global variables have been eliminated
to facilitate thread safety.

The core library, libmdb, is believed to be thread-safe in the sense that
several handles can be opened simultaneously and passed between threads.
However, individual handles are NOT thread-safe, so don't try to do work
on a single handle from multiple threads without implementing your own
locking mechanism.

The auxiliary libraries, libmdbsql and ODBC, still have some non-reentrant
function calls. Thread safety is not promised, though the situation is
significantly improved from the 0.7 days.

The ABI has some slight changes (mostly having to do with struct layouts) so
you'll need to bump your SO numbers and such. The main changes to the API are
the introduction of a new function for in-memory parsing:

  MdbHandle *mdb_open_buffer(void *buffer, size_t len, MdbFileFlags flags);

And the modification of the "mdb_set_date_fmt" function to include a handle
parameter, so that date formats can be set in a non-global fashion:

  void mdb_set_date_fmt(MdbHandle *mdb, const char *);

The above function is the most common reason that old projects will fail to
compile on 0.9, and the fix is straightforward.

The previously-deprecated functions mdb_init() and mdb_exit() have been
removed. These functions did nothing; any calls to them should be excised with
prejudice.

This release introduces two new CLI tools (mdb-count and mdb-queries) and
deprecates mdb-array, mdb-header, and mdb-parsecsv. Several man pages have been
added or otherwise brought up to date.

The GNOME-based GUI tool that formerly shipped with MDB Tools has been moved to
a separate project, here:

    https://github.com/mdbtools/gmdb2

It seems to compile but should probably be classified as abandonware. The
project uses a deprecated GUI toolkit, and as such gmdb2 is no longer included
in Linux distros that used to carry it.

Version 0.7.1
=============
autogen.sh is no more. Use "autoreconf -if" to bootstrap the configuration.

autoconf/automake has been updated to more recent standards.
- config.guess  config.sub  depcomp  install-sh  ltmain.sh  missing  ylwrap
  files are now in build-aux/ directory
You'll now need autoconf >= 2.58

An experimental (buggy) version of ODBC driver that supports UCS-2 interface
is now available: libmdbodbcW.so
Note that libmdbodbc supports UTF-8 really well, so that this is usually not
needed.

Version 0.3
===========
The organization of the project files has changed a bit from that last release.
The autoconf stuff has been moved to the root directory.  The include directory
has also been moved from src/include to include
