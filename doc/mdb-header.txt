NAME
  mdb-header - Write header file from an MDB database

SYNOPSIS
  mdb-header [database]

DESCRIPTION
  mdb-header is a utility program distributed with MDB Tools.

  It will dump the names and types of the tables and columns in
  an MDB database in a C header format.

  It will create three files - types.h and dumptypes.[ch]

ENVIRONMENT
  MDB_JET3_CHARSET    Defines the charset of the input JET3 (access 97) file. Default is CP1252. See iconv(1).
  MDBICONV            Defines the output charset. Default is UTF-8. mdbtools must have been compiled with iconv.
  MDBOPTS             semi-column separated list of options:
                      * use_index
                      * no_memo
                      * debug_like
                      * debug_write
                      * debug_usage
                      * debug_ole
                      * debug_row
                      * debug_props
                      * debug_all is a shortcut for all debug_* options

EXIT STATUS
  mdb-header exits with error code 1 if there was anunsupported type.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
  mdb-header is deprecated. Soon, it will no longer be distributed.

  It is the feeling of developers that it is not used, as C code generation
  is now usually replaced by more generic approaches, including libmdb calls
  and odbc.

  However, should you find this tool useful, drop us a line at
  https://github.com/mdbtools/mdbtools/issues/197
  and we'll consider maintaining it.
